## Current State Technology
These are the tools and tech used inside of the repo and the rational reason behind it.

**1. Go Fiber**

As someone who currently switching from NodeJS to Golang, I picked the Go Fiber framework because it provides a development experience similar to the popular NodeJS Express framework.

For me, the conversion to Golang has been a learning experience, and I needed a framework that would make the process as easy as possible. Fiber's Express-like syntax and middleware architecture made it simple for me to get started rapidly constructing API endpoints in Golang.

Another advantage of adopting Fiber is its simplicity. Because Fiber has a tiny codebase and few dependencies, my applications have a smaller attack surface and are less vulnerable to security flaws.

Overall, adopting Fiber has made my shift from NodeJS to Golang easier and more pleasurable. Its Express-like syntax and middleware stack have made writing clean, organized code a pleasure, and its efficiency and minimalist approach have given me confidence in the scalability of my projects.

**2. PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL was chosen as my database management system since it is a widely used and preferred solution for enterprise-level software. PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database that has been in development for more than 30 years and has a huge and active user and contributor community.

I've been working with PostgreSQL for a long time, so I'm familiar with its syntax, features, and capabilities, making it easier for me to design and manage applications using it. Furthermore, PostgreSQL has proven to be a dependable and scalable option for data storage and management, which is crucial for enterprise-level applications.

Another advantage of choosing PostgreSQL is its extensive feature set, which includes support for sophisticated data types, full-text search, and spatial data. PostgreSQL also features strong transaction support and fine-grained control over access and permissions, making it a safe and flexible option for data management.

Furthermore, PostgreSQL has strong interface with other technologies and frameworks, including Golang, via database drivers and ORMs such as GORM, making it easy for me to design apps that exploit PostgreSQL's features.
